        Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved all the music and a boy who
        loved none (except Snoop and Die Antwoord, of course). She had always
        imagined the man of her dreams to fit the rule of three: he would love
        Prince, Tom Petty, and Was (Not Was). It turns out the universe knew
        what she needed most was a man who always allowed her to play DJ.

        They met in 2013 at a bar called Uncle Fatty’s. It was spring, and a
        cover band in marching band uniforms were playing. She spotted him on
        the dance floor sporting a light blue plaid sports coat. It was the era
        of Macklemore’s “Thrift Shop,” one of her favorite songs. This led to an
        instant connection from across the floor. They spoke numerous times that
        night; however, she was guarded. He was a gentleman and paid
        for her cab home to ensure she was safe. Smooth, though, he was not…he
        noted he would be asking her on a date but not to fret, that he would
        wait a week to call her. And yet, she received texts daily until they
        met up the next weekend. Their first date was at a Michigan State bar,
        which was serendipitous as she is a diehard Spartan. He took her to a
        Michelin star restaurant, and she ended the night to go see Jurassic
        Park with a friend. This was another serendipitous moment as Jurassic
        Park is Andy’s favorite movie (seriously. Just listen to his ringtone.)

        From there, it was a blur of pizza nights, music festivals, dancing in
        Rock N Roll heaven, introductions to their beloved friends…but no one
        can forget the first moment when it *clicked* after they both made a
        behind-the-back shot into the cup during a beer pong game. Truly unheard
        of.

        It was after their first Thanksgiving together they said “I love you.”
        He supported her emotionally as she finished graduate school and
        ventured to find herself in the professional world. Likewise, she has
        offered unconditional support in his endeavor to reprioritize his
        professional goals.

        In 2015 they moved in together into an apartment in Edgewater, Chicago.
        It was close to the beach for her, and to Jerry’s whiskey bar…also for
        her. They quickly adopted two cats, and a year later a dog. They have
        grown together over travels to Florida, California, Las Vegas, Mackinac
        Island, and Mexico. In 2018, they plunged into a move to the suburbs.
        They have worked to make their apartments a home for them and the
        animals. She loves to cook for him. They spend time watching Marvel
        movies, going to the dog park, working on their bowling technique, and
        playing board games.

        Around the holidays in 2017, Andy and Ashley realized they were ready to
        further venture into commitment to each other and voiced their wishes to
        spend the rest of their lives together. Andy began working with his
        mother and a local jeweler to design a unique ring. He attempted to
        propose three times in July, but his plans were always thwarted by
        Ashley making plans elsewhere. At last, though, the day came where he
        asked Ashley to be his partner in life. If you ask her, she knew it was
        happening the entire day. “He’s not sneaky”, she says. “He asked if we
        could go to dinner that night but would not share where, and insisted he
        bring his satchel because his ‘pants were too tight’ to hold his keys.
        This didn’t make since considering I always carry a purse…” alas, they
        began their night at Shaw’s Crab House, their go-to spot for fancy surf
        ‘n’ turf and Old Fashioned’s. Now, many of you know Ashley, and will not
        be surprised that as soon as Andy began to get down on one knee, she
        pulled him into the booth instead. “I wanted it to be intimate, not
        shared with the rest of the room.” What was said between them is
        essentially a blur, other than “YES!!”, but the emotions shared are
        what’s remembered by both.
