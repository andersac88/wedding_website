                After we became engaged in July, 2018, we pondered for weeks about our wants and needs for a wedding venue. It was a first point of marital compromise. We decided on Southwest Michigan as a perfect medium for our Michigander and Illinoisan friends and family. Ideally, we were looking for a location that was able to hold up on its own rather than a space which had limited option for decor.</p>

                It turns out we only had to view one venue - the WK Kellogg Manor House spoke for itself! It is a historical landmark being the summer estate for WK Kellogg and his family, and has historical decor throughout the venue. Before even going inside, Andy was eager to learn about the historical presence the venue had. We fell in love with the deep wood furniture and tapestries around the venue. Ashley was particularly excited about the garden landscape and the MSU water tower in view from the parking lot! It also sits on Gull Lake, which will offer a wonderful backdrop to our nuptials (weather permitting!). We hope this venue offers an accurate representation of our personalities - we cannot wait to celebrate our love with you at this beautiful Manor House! </p>
